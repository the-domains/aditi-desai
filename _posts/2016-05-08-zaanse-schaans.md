Zaanse Schaans ! 

A 45 minute drive from the Amsterdam City Centre brings you to a small town called the Zaanse Schans !! 

The very minute you reach this little town you feel the scent of joy in the air. Little green houses with people in their traditional costumes making merry. This tiny village is situated along the backdrop of well preserved historic windmills that form the centre of attraction of this beautiful town. 

There is something about the air that uplifts your mood altogether.
