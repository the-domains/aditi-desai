> I am Aditi Desai

living in Stockholm. A biotechnologist with a business degree, born and brought up in India I represent a mix of cultures, traditions, geographies, languages and ideas. The idea of travelling always occupied an important part of my brain but I could never realise it until I took off for my first travel after I moved to Stockholm. And after then it has just been a journey to Self discovery.
