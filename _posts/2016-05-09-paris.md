Paris 

The city of light ! And a lotttttt of people as well. Oh my god this city refuses to stay calm . The spirits are always high ! 

It is here that the tall grey Ugly tower stands tall, attracting thousands each day to hear them say " Oh, It's soooo Romantic ! " How Ironic is that! Thousands of years history remain preserved in the Musuem de Louvre which attracts thousands each day to get an insight on what we carry along with us as a legacy.
