Keukenhof - The land of Tulips ! 

The best part of visiting Amsterdam during this time of the year is that you get to visit the Tulip festival. A half an hour ride from the Schipol Airport, the place transforms into a beautiful fairyland. A place where you would love to get lost into, Keukenhoff is an explosion of colors, aroma, nature therapy to the eyes.
